as3swf is an actionscript 3 library for handling the SWF file format.

  * read SWF from ByteArray
  * file header info
  * SWF attributes
  * SWF metadata
  * frame and scene data
  * library bitmaps
  * symbol names
  * DoABC (AS3)
  * simple to add support for more tags


_I highly recommend downloading the SWF File Format specification from Adobe in addition to this code._
